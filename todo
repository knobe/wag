- add a .rss file that is like a hosts file:
  <name> <rss address>

run test cases where template doesn't exist
run test cases where url doesn't exist
html2text for those ugly atom feeds, or a deeper parser for example reddit feed
  - maybe jinja templates

a better setup.py that creates dirs for us
